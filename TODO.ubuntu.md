# Ubuntu - TODO

## 24.10

[x] - `lsb-core` - is not existing package that was installed using specific ubuntu-2104 script that was copied to ubuntu-41. Need to investigate what is the replacement package.
        ANSWER: package was dropped from the distribution as LSB project was abandoned and not maintained.
